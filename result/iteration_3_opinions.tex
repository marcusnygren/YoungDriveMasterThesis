  \subsubsection{Josefina feedback}

  \textbf{Acceptance criteria}

If you have a high score, you are ready. If not, you need to redo the quiz.

If you are 8/10 or lower, you are in the red zone. If lower than 10/10, they are not ready, the motivation being that what they don't know, they will teach in an improper way: affecting hundreds of youth. This is why Josefina thinks they should need all of the answers correct.
