\subsection{Co-Creation Workshops}

There were two workshops held with the Zambia coaches: one at the beginning of the week (before being shown the app), and one at the end of the week (after having used the app for a week). Below, the learning from these two workshops are presented.

\subsubsection{Co-Designing an App for the YoungDrive Training}

    The result gave an unbiased look at what the coaches expected from the app, what functionality wasn't important, and into their technical preferences. A simpler design than originally thought was deemed sufficient, and the simple sketches guided continued development of the app during the week. See figure \ref{fig:zambia1A2}, \ref{fig:zambia1B2}, \ref{fig:zambia1C0} and \ref{fig:zambia1C1} for reference. The time spent on designing the YoungDrive app in two iterations took the coaches circa 1 hour and 40 minutes.

    From using the devices during the workshop (to find inspiration from other apps like Duolingo and Quizoid), it was found that most coaches prefer using the tablet (5 for tablet, versus 2 for smartphone and 2 for computer). Both the designs and insights gained were used throughout the week to further improve the simple app created at the end of iteration 1. The workshop gave great insights to who the coaches were and their thinking.

    \subsubsection{Understanding what Builds Confidence among Coaches}

    During this workshop, the focus was to examine what builds confidence among the coaches. Four themes were identified, after clustering the notes according to similarities: "I believe in myself" (3 coaches), "I believe in God" (2 coaches), "I am well prepared" (4 coaches) and "I am certified" (1 coach). See figure \ref{fig:zambiaWorkshop2} for the different clusters. Josefina comments after the workshop: â€œI have a problem: There is no way I can control them how they have prepared themselves for a youth session.".
