\subsection{Analysis of Questions in Regards to Bloom's Revised Taxonomy}

%Analysing the quiz questions is one of the most important prerequisites to evaluate the learning effect of the app.

%The analysis of the questions showed that in general, where the question performed on Bloom's Revised Taxonomy got gradually higher for each new topic.

Analysing the questions by each topic according to Bloom's Revised Taxonomy, showed that questions on average gradually reached higher levels on both the knowledge dimension and the cognitive dimension. In topic 1 of 10, most questions only reached the first level of the knowledge dimension ("Factual") and cognitive process dimension ("Remember"). In quizzes created at the end of the week (like topic 9 of 10), questions reached up to "Analyse" on the cognitive process dimension (level 4, not reaching "Evaluate" or "Create"), and the whole range of the knowledge dimensions ("Factual, "Conceptual", "Procedural" and "Metacognitive").
