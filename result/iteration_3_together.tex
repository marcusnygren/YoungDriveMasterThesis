\subsection{Iteration \#3}

  för learning och självreflektion, men ej för effektivitet

  \textit{Deliberate practice: not satisfied.} The lesson learned is that while the app is now designed for learning, it is not designed for speed. It took too long to get certified to be within the realms of deliberate practice.

  Help them practice right. Goal: design practice exercises that will take a fine-grained task from unreliable to 95\% reliability, within one to three 45-90-minute sessions.

  If not possible, don't continue trying: split into smaller tasks, Sierra says.

  While there was now an MVP for the coach training, there was not yet a MVP for the youth session; only an MP (minimum product, but not viable yet).

  To improve effectiveness, it was determined that "learning by thinking", regarding metacognitive skills, could be beneficial. This would help the coach to analyze and evaluate its own learning, possibly improving faster in the app.

  \subsubsection{Bonus results}
  The Kampala test showed how well the app works for learning entrepreneurship also outside of the YoungDrive context. Some modifications would greatly improve this further.
