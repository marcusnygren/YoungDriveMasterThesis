\subsubsection{Online data collection}
To test on all of the coaches in Uganda, it would have been preferable if data collection would have happened via the app instead of manually already in iteration 3, since there would be more than 10 test subjects, which had been the limit in Zambia. This was planned for, but technical implications with Meteor made it delayed.

\todo{Does it really work pushing data via GroundDB after 15 minutes? I don't know.}

\subsubsection{Working with technical constaints}
Upgrading from version 1.2 to 1.3 during Iteratoin 3 was a good example of technical limitations. Since 1.2 did not work for old Android devices, a "better" version of software was not viable.

A lot of time where spent "wasted", and time during that iteration needed to be taken back by working the Friday night and Saturday, before the travel to Tororo.

\subsection{Implementation}
Could have benefitted from Continuous Integration, passing tests before ready for production. Solved this by having a stage environment (since April 19th) where stage is YoungDrive-beta (branch Iteration 4), and YoungDrive is master. Doing automated tests would could have helped finding regression errors, things that had worked previously but not in a new version. This in turn, would have made interactions with coaches better, since the app would have been more complete. \todo{Förbättra denna}

\subsubsection{Difficulties comparing quiz results between iterations}

The idea was that app tests for iteration \#3 would be carried out in a way that allowed comparison of usability and learning done between iteration \#2 in Zambia and iteration \#3 in Uganda. This was however never implemented during the app test. This would been useful, but the coaches and the usage of the app in Zambia and Uganda was determined to be too different. For future work, more work should be put into how quiz results can be compared between different versions of the app and across different contexts and cultures.
