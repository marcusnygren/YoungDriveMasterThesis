\section{How can test questions be developed to support entrepreneurship learning?} % Bloom

  %\subsubsection{The benefit of having quizzes for the whole YoungDrive training}

  The initial plan was that YoungDrive would only produce questions for two YoungDrive training weeks, not all 10. To have questions for all of the weeks have greatly benefited the master thesis, and increased the value of the final product. If not all quizzes would have been developed and tested, this would have been a Future Work.

  From a question assessment, it is shown that all of Bloom's levels can be reached via the app, but two: create, and apply. This is because users can not create anything in the app, and they can not match knowledge towards what suits them.
