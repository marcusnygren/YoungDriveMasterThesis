% %Ingen rapport kan göra anspråk på att ha löst problemen inom ett område på ett uttömmande sätt. Därför är det viktigt att visa på vilket sätt du själv eller  andra kan använda dina resultat i andra studier i framtiden. Den avslutande  diskussionen blir till sin karaktär mer subjektiv, men se till att du inte  spekulerar alltför vilt.

%\todo{Alla källor jag nämner, de behöver jag egentligen diskutera i Discussion-delen. Då börjar jag vrända och vida på saker, och hitta olika tankemönster = Vad som stämmer och inte stämmer i det jag sett jämfört med teorin}

The discussion section is framed by revisiting the five research questions. For each question, important aspects are considered, often comparing with the literature. This then leads to the conclusions of the master thesis, and future work.

\section{Summary}

As of now, the app can not be said to evaluate how good the coaches are with teaching. Neither, it helps them assess their ability to learn (it sure would be valuable for coaches to track their ability to get better and remember, see chapter \ref{cha:future-work} Future Work). The app does however help the coaches to assess their knowledge level and what areas they need to train on.

Moreover, the coaches seems to like the app, which is important. There are tendencies that the app works better for some coaches, especially those who take time to reflect on the feedback given by the app. This speaks for designing the app for different need groups. If motivation and confidence is high, it could indicate them becoming better teachers, but as of know there are no evidence of this more than that the coaches themselves has identified that confidence is important for having a good youth lecture.

A bonus result is that the app allows also the teacher to assess the knowledge level of the coaches on a day to day basis during the training, giving insight into how well their teaching has been received. The teacher can use this data to understand what they need to repeat the following day, or if adapting their teaching will lead to higher results. Allowing the teacher to analyse their test questions according to Bloom's Revised Taxonomy created awareness of what knowledge level they were assessing the coaches with by their questions, and motivated matching the formulation of a question to the knowledge and cognitive process dimension suitable for the educational objective.
