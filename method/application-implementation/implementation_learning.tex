\subsection{Implementation of Learning Methods}

\subsubsection{Considerations for Entrepreneurship Education}
The scope of the app is to examine and strengthen the entrepreneurship the student already has. One important goal is to give good feedback.

The YoungDrive's entrepreneurship education methodology goes hand in hand with the presented theory. It's mottos are: "Dream big, start small", "Learning by doing" and "We have fun!" \cite{youngdrive}.

Both in regards to designing for the users and for the above reason, the app should be a complement to YoundDrive's existing training material and the structure of the program.

A challenging part of the work is that YoungDrive consists of both the practical skills of the entrepreneur, theoretical material of running a business, and an entrepreneurial mindset. Therefore, both how to assess knowledge, and build habits, needs to be examined.
