\section{Limitations}
%Du kan också redogöra för avgränsningar här. Dessa kanske du inte kan precisera i början av arbetet utan de växer fram under arbetets gång.

The following things will be overlooked:
\begin{itemize}
% Please rephrase, solely on material repetition
\item Learning new material, will not be a focus of this thesis. Instead, material repetition is priority. As a consequence, instead of having three control groups: one group which has had the YoungDrive program and the app, one which has the YoungDrive program but without the app, and one which has not had the YoungDrive program but had the app, I will focus solely on how existing material  can be tested and improved.
\end{itemize}

An implication of the time limit is that how the app should be designed for long-term development, after the Master thesis work is finished, will be mostly overlooked.
