The first section is about entrepreneurship education. The two sections thereafter, presents advancements within pedagogical development, applicable to mobile learning: cognitive psychology, and social psychology.

%On January 28th, 2016, Henrik Marklund\ref{effectivelearning-expert} at the educautional technology startup Knowly was interviewed about Pedagogic Development. He means there are two main areas of research, and an additional one.
%The third area, training transfer, is the research on how to make sure a course gives effect in everyday life.

%The third area is training transfer, and asks "How do you make sure a course gives effect in your everyday life?". For YoungDrive, the wish is that the coach training gives effect in the coaches' everyday life. The master thesis aims to be able to assess and encourage this.
