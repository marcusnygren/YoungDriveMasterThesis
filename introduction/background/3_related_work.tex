\subsubsection{Digital tools in a developing world context}

One great example of a mobile banking service that is a true social innovation is Ledger Link, developed by Grameen Foundation in collaboration with Barclays Bank.

The educational app platform iSchool, developed by iSchool Zambia, has been praised and made popular as it was designed to fit the Zambia school curriculum to the point, accessible as a home edition, pupil edition and teacher edition.

\subsubsection{Digital assessment and mobile learning}

Two studies within electronic assessment (e-assessment) or mobile learning (m-learning) have been done that this master thesis is inspired by. One uses deliberate practices on a mobile learning environement \citep{yengin}. The other focused on and further validated the research of various experimental studies, that multiple-choice can be a viable auto-assessment method to improving student learning, especially for m-learning \citep{de-marcos}.
