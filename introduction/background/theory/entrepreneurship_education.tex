Entrepreneurship education has been a growing field of investigation over the last three decades. While \cite{dickson} says there are few empirical studies available, examples include among others \cite{kuratko}, \cite{pittaway} and \cite{bae}. \cite{oviawe} and \cite{iakovleva} has had an interest in interventions for teaching and learning entrepreneurship in the developing world.

First, \cite{oviawe} conclude by how teaching of creativity and problem-solving skills seems to be especially beneficial for entrepreneurship in developed countries. In YoungDrive, the youth are tasked with starting their own business from no capital, which fosters creativity and problem-solving skills.

Further, \cite{iakovleva} indicated that respondents from developing countries do have stronger entrepreneurial intentions than those from developed countries. This stems from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. Their encouragement, is that developing countries need to focus on the development of institutions that can support entrepreneurial efforts. YoungDrive is one such example.

\cite{ruskovaara} concludes, that the teacher seems to be the main factor for entrepreneurship education, and that research agrees with them. There seems to be no indication of difference between men and women, nor previous professional teaching experience. They could find that entrepreneurial activity seems to lead to better entrepreneurship education. \cite{dickson} recommends mainly two things for enhancing entrepreneurship education practices. First, the playful side of teaching and learning is mentioned. Secondly, they encourage teacher training that develops the competences as a mentor, enabler or coach.
