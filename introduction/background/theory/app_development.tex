\subsection{Hybrid App Development}

The history of app and web development is rich and increasingly intertwined. First, websites were developed for desktop only, and when smartphones became popular, they were made responsive.

With today's possibilities of native mobile development or developing a native app using web technologies, there are numerous viable alternatives available if an app should function on several devices, depending on budget and preferences.

One of the main argument for developing an app in web technologies, is that the whole application, including the server, can be written in one programming language, JavaScript (full-stack).

Tools such as Apache Cordova can compile JavaScript applications into native apps. Thus, they can appear on Apple iOS and Android Play Store, as well as on the web, or installable offline on a smartphone from the computer.

JavaScript is developing rapidly as a language, as well as its ecosystem of frameworks and tools. Frameworks have emerged and matured, like Meteor.js, which makes building full-stack applications in JavaScript reliable and fast.

Previously, web hosting has been troublesome for JavaScript server applications. Today, tools such as Meteor.js and Heroku have introduced free and paid hosting for such applications, with smart bindings to code platforms such as GitHub, which makes collaboration and version handling easy.
