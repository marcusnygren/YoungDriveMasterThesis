    %\subsubsection{Why Uganda is Ranked the World's Most Entrepreneurial Country}
    A couple of prominent facts helps to portrait entrepreneurship activity in Uganda:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Uganda can be ranked the world's most entrepreneurial country (with 28\% of the population considered entrepreneurs \citep{goodis})
        \item Uganda is ranked the youngest population in the world (78\% of all Ugandans are below 30 \citep{unPopulation})
        \item Uganda has a very high unemployment rate (62 \% of people between 18â€“30 are unemployed \citep{lostopportunity})
    \end{itemize}

    With a high unemployment rate and little or none social security, starting a business is for many young entrepreneurs simply a tool for survival. But tough conditions can also lead to creativity, and there are as well many innovative entrepreneurs with great ideas and the aim to create positive social impact \citep{nissar}. As \cite{mitchel} says about entrepreneurship, the motivation of entrepreneurship does not need to be solely wealth accumulation anymore. The activity of entrepreneurship contributes to society, in a way that is not captured by the commercial entrepreneurship literature. No matter the reason of starting a business, Uganda's many entrepreneurs are contributing to the national society by boosting the economy and creating new jobs.
