\subsection{Mobile Technology in Uganda's Rural Areas}\label{sec:mobile-uganda}

One of the reasons why mobile services are growing rapidly in Uganda is that the country has invested heavily in communication networks, even connecting remote rural villages with fibre optic cables and thereby connecting them to a world of information.

As much as 65\% of the adults in Uganda owns a cell phone, which has allowed many areas in the country to skip the landline stage of development and jump right to the digital age. For those who hasnâ€™t electricity at home, there are available charging booths for mobiles all over the country.

The wide use of mobile phones in Uganda and other developing countries has lead the way for the development of several innovative mobile services and in many cases the mobile service are way ahead of us  \citep{nissar}. In Sweden mobile banking services that allows us to transfer money through our mobile phones were made popular with Swish, introduced in 2012. In the neighbouring country Kenya, people have had similar services for the last 10 years, and mobile money is since long also common in Uganda.

A prominent example of an app that has previously been developed with the target group in mind is Ledger Link \citep{ledgerlink}. This mobile banking service empowers, developed in partnership with a bank, allows saving groups in rural areas such as Tororo to save money remotely. It is developed with human-centered design methods, and has won several awards.

%For the future of YoungDrive, they want to make the CBT's even better, and collect and take use of data (monitoring and evaluation). Another motivation is scaling and monetization, as Plan International wants to increase the project to more countries, with an increased digital focus, and YoungDrive wants to be independent of project funding (i.e. a social enterprise). This was a great time to introduce digital enablers, where there previously had been no technology-focus, especially towards CBT's and Youth Mentors. The master thesis is the first project which focuses on digital enablers for YoungDrive.
