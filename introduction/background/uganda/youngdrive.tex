\subsection{YoungDrive}

    \cite{youngdrive-web} is based on a Swedish concept, and had previously had a pilot in Botswana, when tasked with running the entrepreneurship module of A working future for Plan International. The organization fosters and educates young entrepreneurs in developing countries. They train the coaches, provide training material, and support the coaches via direction and direct support through co-project leaders and Youth Mentors.

    YoungDrive moves an entrepreneur to location, becoming country manager and "teacher". The teacher educates project leaders during four days, followed by educating coaches, which then roll out the training to the youth groups during 10 sessions, 1 session per week in average. The Community Based Trainers (CBTs) also rolls out other trainings, often simultaneously.

    For the future of YoungDrive, they want to make the CBT's even better, and collect and take use of data (monitoring and evaluation). Another motivation is scaling and monetization, as Plan International wants to increase the project to more countries, with an increased digital focus, and YoungDrive wants to be independent of project funding (i.e. a social enterprise).

    Given the above, this was a great time to introduce digital enablers for YoungDrive, where there previously had been no technology-focus, especially towards CBT's and Youth Mentors. The master thesis is the first project which focuses on digital enablers for YoungDrive.
