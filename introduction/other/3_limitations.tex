\section{Limitations}
%Du kan också redogöra för avgränsningar här. Dessa kanske du inte kan precisera i början av arbetet utan de växer fram under arbetets gång.

The following things will be overlooked:
\begin{itemize}
% Please rephrase, solely on material repetition
\item Solely existing YoungDrive teaching material will tested using the app, not new material, or other entrepreneurship programs.
\item The app will be a compliment to the physical YoungDrive training, not a replacement. This would be interesting continued work.
\item Ideally, the master thesis would include measuring how app usage affected their youth session quality, measured by the coach, the youth, and co-project leaders.
\item If this would have been the case, there could have been three different control groups: A, using the app and the YoungDrive training, B, using only the YoungDrive training, and C, using only the app.
\end{itemize}
