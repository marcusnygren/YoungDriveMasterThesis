    \subsection{Digital Education}
    
    In recent time, e-learning has had a tremendous impact both outside and inside the classroom. Most prominently, Salman Khan innovated flipped classroom when he created Khan Academy, recording high-quality education videos and publishing for free on YouTube. There are also examples of universities innovating, like MIT OpenCourseWare, or startups like Knowly and Lurn. With a growing teacher interest, research so far shows that digital education is hard, risky and possibly rewarding. Thus, digital education shows both great potential and great considerations.
