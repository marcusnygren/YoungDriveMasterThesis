The following sections, are about how to design for effective learning \cite{dirksen}, by designing for the mind, cognitive psychology. % Design for How People Learn (book, torrent)

Cognitive psychology deals with how our brain works in regards to our memory.

The section presents strategies and techniques to design learning for the mind, and what needs to be considered.

Two aspects are especially relevant when it comes to education: how humans can be supported to retaining (the first second) and retrieving (the second section) communicated information.

In how humans learn, the purpose is to find the most powerful strategies and techniques to design effective learning (mapping educational objectives, how to build skills, pattern-matching techniques, and the power of reflection and assessing).

In how people forget, UCLA Bjork's Learning and Forgetting Lab \cite{ucla} researches how people forget, and how to design so that people do not forget ( retrieval practice and spaced practice).

%On January 28th, 2016, Henrik Marklund\ref{effectivelearning-expert} at the educautional technology startup Knowly was interviewed about Pedagogic Development. He means there are two main areas of research, and an additional one.
%The third area, training transfer, is the research on how to make sure a course gives effect in everyday life.

%The third area is training transfer, and asks "How do you make sure a course gives effect in your everyday life?". For YoungDrive, the wish is that the coach training gives effect in the coaches' everyday life. The master thesis aims to be able to assess and encourage this.
