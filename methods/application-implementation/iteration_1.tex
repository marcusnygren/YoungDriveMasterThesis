\subsection{Iteration \#1}
Here, the work and result from iteration \#1 is presented.

\subsubsection{Devices are prepared}
As most of the coaches did not have smartphones or tablets, enough smartpones and tablets were brought with me from Sweden, either donated, borrowed or bought devices. These were a combination of Android and iOS, smartphones and tablets, so the app could be tested on as many platforms as possible. During the user tests, also using a laptop would be tested.

\subsubsection{App/Web Development}
Early in the project, it was thought that existing tools could be used, instead of building the app from scratch. E.g. using existing tools like Knowly or Typeform\footnote{examples include https://showroom.typeform.com/to/ggBJPd and https://showroom.typeform.com/report/njdbt5/dIzi} during the first iterations for understanding users, and during development e.g. the Typeform API (http://typeform.io/). The Typeform API allows developers to create surveys from within their own applications or systems.

\subsubsection{Choosing cross-platform framework}

In the start, Ionic and Meteor were both tested and compared with each other.
