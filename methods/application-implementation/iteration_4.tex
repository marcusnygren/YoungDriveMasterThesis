For iteration \#4, data collection was done by the app itself, which pushes data to the server whenever online (it saves quiz start, and quiz finish). The server receives JSON data from the client, stored in the MongoDB database hosted on Heroku. Each data point is saved in a database called Results, with the signed in user (from the Users database). In the database, there are collections for Users, Quiz Lists, and Quiz Results.
