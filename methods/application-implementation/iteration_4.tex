\subsection{Iteration \#4}

For iteration \#4, data collection was done by the app itself, which pushes data to server whenever online (it saves quiz start, and quiz finish).

The server receives JSON data, stored in a MongoDB database.

Each data point is saved in a database called Results, with the signed in user (from the Users database).

In the API, I added Users, Quiz Lists, and Quiz Results.

Now there was a build-pack for Meteor 1.3 available, so GroundDB could be implemented again. It made me refactor app into 1.3, and I had to redesign routing.

There were a lot of technical issues. GroundDB was successfully used for offline Meteor collections, and pushing offline data whenever online.
