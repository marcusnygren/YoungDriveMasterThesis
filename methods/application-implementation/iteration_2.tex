\subsection{Iteration \#2}
Here, the work and result from iteration \#2 is presented.

\subsubsection{Staging environment using Heroku}
Needed when the Meteor free tier was removed. Connected to deploy from GitHub branches automatically. Could have benefitted from CI, passing tests before ready for production. Solved this by having a stage environment (since April 19th) where stage is YoungDrive-beta (branch Iteration 4), and YoungDrive is master.
