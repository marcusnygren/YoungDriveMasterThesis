Since Meteor was chosen, a multiple-choice quiz tutorial in Meteor was used to guide the first version of the app. Modifications were made, for example making it responsive and changing it to YoungDrive's graphic profile.

The app was pushed to GitHub, and first hosted on Meteor free storage, available via youngdrive.meteorapp.com. For Android and iOS, it was made possible to install the app from the computer.  For each day of the training in Zambia, new quizzes were added to the app, which created a belt path (see \ref{progress-payoffs}).

After iteration 2, a different hosting platform was needed when the Meteor free tier was removed, where Heroku was chosen. Staging environment using Heroku allowed changes on specific GitHub branches to deploy updates automatically on Heroku servers. The MongoDB database was created using the Heroku plugin MongoLab. A Meteor build-pack was used to allow Meteor to be used with Heroku.

It was also tested to upload the app to Android Play Store. The neccessary steps from Cordova needed to be followed, screenshots needed to be uploaded, and some administrative tasks. After this, it only took a day for the app to appear on the Play Store, and everything worked satisfactory.
