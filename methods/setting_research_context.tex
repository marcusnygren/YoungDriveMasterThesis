\subsection{Research context}

The biggest challenge with regards to time constraints and cultural differences is that it is difficult to understand the audience.

It led to me choosing to spend 3 months in Uganda, because the client and academy is there, and start the design process when I'm there. It also led me to wanting to apply service design.

By being in Uganda and applying service design, I will come closer to the client and coaches.

The internet is worse, especially outside Kampala (I will not be able to access 4G, and prices are high).

Working mainly from Kampala, because that is where YoungDrive is situated, means that there is still a long distance to the coaches in Tororo, which is located near the Kenyan border.
