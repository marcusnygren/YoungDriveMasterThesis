The biggest challenge with regards to time constraints and cultural differences is that it is difficult to understand the audience.

Therefore, the whole design and development process will take place in Uganda, with several interactions with the intended users.

The work was carried out from Hive Colab, a co-working space and an innovation hub.

The interactions took place in either Uganda or Zambia, in the locations where training of the coaches and youth takes place.

There were a number of resources made available to support the work, for example the YoungDrive manuals. Each youth is given a \textit{Participant manual}, describing each week of the 10-week YoungDrive program. Coaches are also given a \textit{Coach guide}, which describes how to carry out and teach each week's topic during the youth training.

Working mainly from Kampala, because that is where YoungDrive is situated, means that there is still a long distance to the coaches and youth in Tororo, which is located near the Kenyan border.

Another challenge with being in Uganda compared to Sweden is that internet speed and access is worse, especially outside Kampala.
