\subsection{Setting}

There are two groups, with me included in both of them, which gather at the end of each sprint for a check-up meeting.

The Expert group consisted of Expedition Mondial and LiU Innovation. Expedition Mondial could help with the design process, and LiU Innovation could offer input on social innovation. The meetings mostly lasted for one hour.

The Partner group consisted Iliana Björling from YoungDrive, and Lena Tibell and Konrad Schönborn from Linköping University. In Partner meetings, The Insighs from each iteration was presented and discussed. Then possible decisions were laid out, followed by discussing the alternatives. % Then I tell them about which decisions has been taken and why.

Outside of these groups, these people can also give advice in certain situations. For specific areas, there are also some experts which have been beneficial during the proects. Below, the whole team is explained:

\subsubsection{Supervisors}
The supervisors are from YoungDrive and Linköping University.

The YoungDrive team consists of Iliana Björling, founder of YoungDrive, and Josefina Lönn, country manager in Zambia. They are both helpful in giving knowledge on the entreprenership education program, and giving support.

The Linköping University team consits of Lena Tibell, Professor, and Konrad Schönborn, Doctor, within the Department of Visual Learning and Communication.

\subsubsection{Stakeholders}
The stakeholders are YoungDrive, Plan International and Linköping University.

\textbf{YoungDrive} is the client of the work, and their needs should be satisfied. This person is mainly represented by Iliana Björling, who is part of the YoungDrive Strategic Management Team.

Using service design, the project leaders in Uganda and Zambia, are also considered stakeholders: Josefina Lönn in Zambia, and Patrick John Obbo and Christine Achom in Uganda.

Finally, the most important stakeholder of all according to service design, is the actual users: the coaches. They should be the main consideration of the work.

\textbf{Plan International} is the organization allowing for all the interactions with the end users in Uganda. A similar organization is operational in Zambia. They are the ones that are providing facilities, organizes transport, etcetera. They in turn, have the organization Community Vision, which organizes the coaches. If Plan International or Community Vision does not approve of my work, then the interactions with the coaches will not be possible.

\textbf{Linköping University} is a stakeholder, as the supervisor (Lena Tibell) and examinator (Camilla Forsell) determine if the work is a valid master thesis or not. Also, LiU Innovation is interested in supporting continued work with the project, and their representative Peter Gahnström gives advice on social innovation and how this project can continue in the future during expert meetings.

\subsubsection{The designer and developer}
I take on several roles in my project: most notably that of a designer, developer, but also product owner. It is me that needs to balance all different opinions and requirements, caring for the vision, like mentioned in the chapter "A good designer" \todo{Add reference}. My motivation is three-fold: learn as much as possible, create a successful project, and finish the master thesis.

\subsubsection{Experts}
Since the development country context is new to me, there are also experts involved in the project.

For design process, Susanna Nissar and Erik Widmark from Expedition Mondial has supported with all of their knowledge within service design.

For technical development for rural areas, Julien Tantege, Research Specialist at Grameen Foundation, has offered support before and during the work, sharing their insights from related work, and giving feedback during ideation.

For pedagogical development, Henrik Lundmark from edtech startup Knownly in Sweden has given support with regards to building skills within digital learning.
