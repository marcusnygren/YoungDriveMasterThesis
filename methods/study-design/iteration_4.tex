\subsection{Iteration 4: Uganda Summative Test}

The focus of iteration 4 was a summative test, to assess the learning effect of the app. First, a pre-test was carried out in paper, including questions about the coach and an entrepreneurship quiz, based on a well-known study \citep{general-entrepreneurship-quiz}, see Appendix \ref{cha:pre-test}. During the test, this was the first time that the app could send data to the server. Data was sent whenever a quiz was started, and whenever a quiz was finished. The group was divided into two, the ones who brought manuals and they who did not. Those that had brought manuals, could use these with the app, see figure \ref{fig:appevaluation}.

After the test, every coach was randomly divided into one of three groups. These groups of coaches were interviewed by the current author and the two Tororo project leaders respectively. In the coach groups, they were asked:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Why do you think you were correct or incorrect?
\item Do they like the app?
\item Are you stimulated by the app?
\item What did you like?
\item What did you not like?
\item When do you want to use the app?
\item When are you not able to use the app?
\end{enumerate}

Their answers were recorded by the interviewee on paper as notes, to later be more deeply explained and discussed together with the other interviewers (these summaries were audio recorded for future reference). The exact answers were separated into three different mind maps, depending if they regarded learning, interaction design and service design.

%The next day, a small app evaluation and co-creation workshop was held for the Educator Dashboard, and the final version of the app. Also, a test was done with the Plan Tororo staff.

%Back in Kampala, a presentation was held with Plan International. Back in Sweden, a presentation was held with the YoungDrive Strategic Management Team.
