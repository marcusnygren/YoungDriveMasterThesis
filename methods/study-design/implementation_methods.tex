\subsection{Implementation of methods for data collection and data analysis}

This section describes the implementation of methods for each iteration's interactions, in regards to collecting and analysing qualitative and quantitative data. Figure \ref{fig:methods} is made to assist the reader in which methods were used together.

%study design, application development, and for data analysis theory.
