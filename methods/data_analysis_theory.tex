\section{Data Analysis Framework}

%Methods to choose from for analysing (i.e. what I did during the interactions, to test and analyze my app)

%Partly data collection done via app, but also all the observations

The results from each iteration needed to be analysed, using the methods outlined in section \ref{sec:data-analysis}. Depending on the kind of activity and results gathered, different data is collected. For qualitative methods, the output is almost always \textit{observation notes}, which are then concluded into insights. These insights, can then sometimes be used in the below analysis methods. For quantitative data, the output is almost always \textit{quiz results} or data about the coaches. Before analysis, how this data has been processed is clearly described in chapter \ref{sec:data-analysis}.

Below, an overview of which data analysis methods was used in what iteration is presented. Then, in the following sections, each activity with data collection is mapped to each of these data analysis methods.

\begin{itemize}
\item Qualitative data
\begin{itemize}
\item Need groups and Personas (\#1)
\item Customer Journey Map (\#1)
\item Sprint backlog (\#1, \#2, \#3, \#4)
\item Sprint demo (\#1, \#2, \#3, \#4)
\end{itemize}
\item Quantitative data
\begin{itemize}
\item Correlation in Google Sheets (\#2, \#3, \#4)
\item Correlation in R (\#4)
\item Logistical regression in R (\#4)
\item Parallel coordinates visualisation (\#4)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Iteration 1: Uganda Coach Visit}

In iteration 1, the following activities were carried out and then analysed:

\begin{itemize}
\item Stakeholder interview (for Need groups)
\item Coach interview and field visit (for Need groups)
\item Workshop (for Customer Journey Map)
\item Smartphone test (for Need groups)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Iteration 2: Zambia Coach Training}

In iteration 2, the following activities were carried out and then analysed:

\begin{itemize}
\item App test observations (for Sprint backlog)
\item Quiz results (for Sprint demo)
\item App design workshop: use case 1 (for Sprint backlog)
\item App design workshop: use case 2 (for Need groups)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Iteration 3: Uganda Formative Test}

In iteration 3, the following activities were carried out and then analysed:

\begin{itemize}
\item App test observations (for Sprint backlog)
\item Service Mini-Sprint - 5 workshops (for Sprint backlog)
\item Field visits (for Sprint demo)
\item Small formative app test (for Sprint backlog)
\item Big formative app test (for Sprint demo)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Iteration 4: Uganda Summative Test}

In iteration 4, the following activities were carried out and then analysed:

\begin{itemize}
\item Big summative app test (for Sprint demo and quantitative analysis)
\end{itemize}
