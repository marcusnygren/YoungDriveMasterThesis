%Methods to choose from for analysing (i.e. what I did during the interactions, to test and analyze my app)

%Partly data collection done via app, but also all the observations

First, a pre-test was carried out in paper, including questions about the coach and an entrepreneurship quiz, based on a well-known study \cite{general-entrepreneurship-quiz}.

During the test, this was the first time that the app could send data to the server. Data was sent whenever a quiz was started, and whenever a quiz was finished.

After the test, every coach was divided into one or three groups, on random. In these groups, they were asked:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Why do you think you were correct or incorrect?
\item Do they like the app?
\item Are you stimulated by the app?
\item What did you like?
\item What did you not like?
\item When do you want to use the app?
\item When are you not able to use the app?
\end{enumerate}

Then, to analyse the data, all of this was combined first into a Google Spreadsheet, then doing statistical analysis in R, followed by a parallell coordinates visualization.
