%Methods to choose from for analysing (i.e. what I did during the interactions, to test and analyze my app)

%Partly data collection done via app, but also all the observations

The results from each iteration needed to be analysed, using the methods outlined in section \ref{sec:data-analysis}. Depending on the kind of activity and results gathered, different data is collected.

For qualitative methods, the output is almost always observation notes, which are then concluded into insights. These insights, can then sometimes be used in the below analysis methods.

For quantitative data, the output is almost always quiz results or data about the coaches. Before analysis, how this data has been processed is clearly described in chapter \ref{sec:data-analysis}.

Below, an overview of which data analysis method was used for what data is presented. The tools and iteration the tool was used in, is outlined below as a summary:

Qualitative data analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Need groups and Personas (\#1)
\item Customer Journey Map (\#1)
\item Sprint backlog (\#1, \#2, \#3, \#4)
\item Sprint demo (\#1, \#2, \#3, \#4)
\end{enumerate}

Quantitative data analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Correlation in Google Sheets (\#2, \#3, \#4)
\item Correlation in R (\#4)
\item Logistical regression in R (\#4)
\item Parallel coordinates visualisation (\#4)
\end{enumerate}

\todo{Fortsätt beskriva vilka metoder som användes i de olika aktiviteterna}

\subsection{Iteration \#1}
%Here I used:

Stakeholder interview
Coach interview and field visit
Customer Journey Map
Smartphone test

\subsection{Iteration \#2}
%Here I used:

App test observations
Quiz results
App design workshop: use case 1
App design workshop: use case 2

\subsection{Iteration \#3}
%Here I used:
App test observations
Service Mini-Sprint - 5 workshops
Field visits
Small formative app test
Big formative app test

\subsection{Iteration \#4: Quiz Results Analysis}
%Here I used:

Google Sheets
R
Paralell coordinates

Data analysis of quiz results is done first by a general overview in Google Sheets, by statistical analysis in R, and by a parallel coordinates visualization. The process to do this, is described below.
