%Methods to choose from for analysing (i.e. what I did during the interactions, to test and analyze my app)

%Partly data collection done via app, but also all the observations

The results from each iteration needed to be analysed, see the previous figure \ref{studydesign}. Depending on the kind of activity and results gathered, different data is collected. For qualitative methods, the output is almost always notes and observations, which are then concluded into insights. These insights, can then sometimes be used in the below analysis methods. For quantitative data, the output is almost always \textit{quiz results} or data about the coaches. Before analysis, how this data has been processed is clearly described. Then, in the following sections, each data analysis methods is described.

%After this, an overview of which data analysis methods was used in what iteration is presented.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Qualitative data
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Need groups and Personas (iteration \#1, constructed from stakeholder and coach interviews, field visits, and smartphone test)
%\item Customer Journey Map (iteration \#1, from workshop with coaches)
%\item Sprint backlog (iteration \#1, \#2, \#3, \#4, from feedback and observations during app tests, plus app design workshops)
%\item Sprint demo (iteration \#1, \#2, \#3, \#4, presenting quiz results and field visit findings)
%\end{itemize}
%\item Quantitative data (from quiz results and data about the coaches)
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Correlation in Google Sheets (iteration \#2, \#3, \#4)
%\item Correlation in R (iteration \#4)
%\item Logistical regression in R (iteration \#4)
%\item Parallel coordinates visualisation (iteration \#4)
%\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}
