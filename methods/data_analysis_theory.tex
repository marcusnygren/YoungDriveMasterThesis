%Methods to choose from for analysing (i.e. what I did during the interactions, to test and analyze my app)

%Partly data collection done via app, but also all the observations

%After this, an overview of which data analysis methods was used in what iteration is presented.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Qualitative data
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Need groups and Personas (iteration \#1, constructed from stakeholder and coach interviews, field visits, and smartphone test)
%\item Customer Journey Map (iteration \#1, from workshop with coaches)
