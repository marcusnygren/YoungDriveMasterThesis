Design for How People Learn

"Traditional instructional design approaches focus heavily on contentâ€“getting it complete and accurate. Then making presentations as clear as possible. Then making assessments precise. 

Concerns about the learning experience, making it meaningful, memorable, and motivational, may not even enter the discussion.

I guess it's no wonder that we have so many boring and ineffective programs."

- Foreword, Michael W. Allen, Ph.D.
