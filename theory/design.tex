\section{Design}

\textbf{What contextual technical constraints need to be overcome, and what compromises need to be made, in design of the app?}

The goal is to make the app as sophisticated as possible with as little menace as possible.

The overall question is how much the designer needs to know about the present situation in order to have a good foundation for the design work. In order to decide, she needs to \citep{interactiondesign-lowgren}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item She has to decide which dimensions of a design situation to examine
    \item Other issues include how much information is needed, what techniques and methods are suitable, and how much time is available.
\end{itemize}

There are three roles an interaction designer can take \citep{interactiondesign-lowgren}: computer expert, socio-technical expert, and political agent.

It is very important to understand the constraints when planning a proposed method. Therefore, these are delved deeper into in this section.\\
