\subsubsection{Building Expertise}

divides expertise into three areas:
(A) "Can't do (but need to do)"
(B) "Can do with efford"
(C) "Mastered (reliable/automatic).
The goal is to always moving this across this board.

But there are three main problems:
1 Pile-up on B (there are too many cognitive resources)
2 The Intermediate Blue (something has made it see it's not high quality)
3 Too slow

Fixing the problems:
1. Fixing the pile-up on B - Keep more on A (this is common, but not the best solution).

2. Split B into subskills to move to C (How progress happens, getting it right 95 out of 100): Maximum 3 sessions, maximum 45-90 minutes/session - according to 50 years of cognitive research) - half-a-skill beats a half-assed skill.
Practice makes perfect < Practice makes permanent
- Crucial: reduce time spent practicing being mediocre

3. Since people revisit old knowledge, that's unneccesray check. We want to Bypass B. Perceptual learning is utilizing how the brain is brilliant at pattern-matching. This is why there are experts who can't teach you how to do it, but they don't know and thus can't teach the pattern-matching.

This is what we need:
- High quality (during a very limited time)
- Very high-quantity examples (200-300 examples)

Care about one another's scarce cognitive resources. We're not humanoids. We're humans.
