According to Dickson \cite{dickson}, there are few empirical studies available on entrepreneurship education.

Ruskovaara \& Pihkala \cite{ruskovaara} concludes, that the teacher seems to be the main factor for entrepreneurship education, and that research agrees with them.

There seems to be no indication of difference between men and women, nor previous professional teaching experience.

Entrepreneurial activity seems to lead to better entrepreneurship education.

Recommendations for enhancing entrepreneurship education practices are mainly two things.

First, the playful side of teaching and learning is mentioned \cite{solomon}.

Secondly, they encourage teacher training that develops the competences as a mentor, enabler or coach.
