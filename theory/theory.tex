Below, the findings of literature and interviews is presented, for each relevant subject the master thesis has involved.

The literature and interviews aims to give a theoretical answer for research question \#1, and guidance for how the method can answer the research question. Some of the literature also suggests how to answer research question \#2.

\section{Methods}

Experts and literature has been used to get a theoretical understanding of the relevant research areas.

In the first section, experts in the project are described with their name, role and professional area. In the second section, the literature basis is presented.

\subsection{Experts}
I want to thank the following experts, who either have already helped me with finding research material, or will contribute with knowledge during the project.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Service design: Susanna Nissar and Erik Widmark, Expedition Mondial
	\item Social innovation: Peter Gahnström, LiU Innovation
    \item Technical support: Daniel Marklund and Stefan FalkBoman, YoungDrive
    \item Entrepreneurship education: Konrad Schönborn, Linköping University, Joachim Svärdh, Thoren Innovation School, Iliana Björling, YoungDrive, Josefina Lönn, YoungDrive
	\item E-learning: Henrik Marklund, Pedagogic Development at Lurn AB % Annika Silvervarg, Educational Technology Group at Linköping University.
    %\item Others
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Literature}

Below, the planned literature basis is presented, for each relevant subject the master thesis will involved. The topics are: \\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Service Design

    \citep{interactiondesign-beyer}
    
    \item Entrepreneurship \& Entrepreneurship Education
    \citep{entrepreneurship-pihkala}
    
    \item Learning % formative assessment (given to you, for your own sake) instead of summative assessment (given to the employee, for the employee's sake). You have to secure that it's a process. You have to see that there is an effect! "Assessing for Learning" :) - much debated, has drawbacks. Feedback is one of the most effective ways for learning.
