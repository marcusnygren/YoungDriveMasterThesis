\section{Theory}

To understand how to reach the objectives of the project, this chapter presents relevant theories.

There are four parts relating to the design situation (section 1-4), and four parts relating to relevant research (section 5-8).

\subsubsection{Part 1-4: Design situation}
For design situation, the client context is described. This also includes a motivation for digital learning, and related work to the thesis.

The first section describes the opportunities for entrepreneurship in Uganda, followed by how Plan International and YoungDrive uses this to tackle child poverty by fostering and educating youth in starting their own businesses. This section concludes by how digital learning and digital tools becomes increasingly demanded, which is why this master thesis has emerged.

\subsubsection{Part 5-8: Relevant research}
For relevant research, design for learning and motivation has been studied, as well as creating a design process and hybrid app development.
