  abstract =      {"As one case in point, part of Sjödén’s research involved getting two groups of pupils to play a maths game which involved interacting with a computer character for eight weeks.
To assess if this was improving learning, he set one group a digital maths test where the same
character featured. Another group took the same maths test but without their digital friend.
The results were telling. "The pupils that were helping their digital friend were more engaged.
They were almost three times more likely to click ‘yes’ when the computer asked them if they
wanted to continue to harder sums," says Sjödén. Low-performing pupils became especially
motivated.
Sjödén thinks imaginative games like this can really bring home the advantages of e-learning.
“If none of the large, well-established companies will [take this on], I hope that one of the new enterprises will succeed. The developer who makes the first real digital learning tool will have control of that entire market,” he said.},
